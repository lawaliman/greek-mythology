            <h2>Introduction to Greek Mythology</h2>
            <p>
                Greek mythology is a collection of stories and legends that form a fundamental part of ancient Greek culture. These myths were created to explain the natural world, human behavior, and the origins of their customs and rituals. They feature a wide array of deities, heroes, and mythical creatures, each with their unique stories and characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the heart of Greek mythology are the Olympian gods, who resided on Mount Olympus under the rule of Zeus, the king of the gods. These gods, such as Hera, Poseidon, Athena, and Apollo, played significant roles in shaping the world and influencing human affairs. Each god had distinct attributes, symbols, and areas of influence, from love and beauty to war and wisdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the gods, Greek mythology is rich with tales of heroes and epic adventures. Figures like Hercules, Perseus, and Odysseus embarked on legendary quests that tested their strength, bravery, and wit. These stories of heroism and adventure not only entertained ancient audiences but also conveyed moral lessons and cultural values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Greek mythology has had a profound impact on Western culture and continues to inspire art, literature, and popular culture today. From ancient sculptures and paintings to modern films and books, the stories of Greek mythology remain timeless, captivating audiences with their themes of love, betrayal, courage, and the eternal struggle between good and evil.
